      The Chola dynasty, one of the longest-ruling dynasties in the history of southern India, flourished from around the 9th to the 13th century AD. Renowned for their military prowess, maritime achievements, and patronage of art and architecture, the Cholas left an indelible mark on Indian history. Under their rule, trade and cultural exchange thrived, evidenced by the grand temples and intricate bronze sculptures that stand as enduring legacies of their golden era.

      Babur was the founder of the Mughal empire which was established in 1526 after Babur defeated Ibrahim Lodi in the
      first battle of Panipat.
      Thus a new epoch and a new empire in India began, lasting for nearly three centuries beginning from 1526 to 1857.
      Six major rulers of this dynasty, Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir, Shah Jahan and Aurangzeb, known as the “Great
      Mughals”, left their mark on Indian
      history. The empire declined after the death of Aurangzeb in 1707.
